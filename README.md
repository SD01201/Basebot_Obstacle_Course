Course Description:
Our Course has around 5 obstacles which our robot will have to go through. The 5 obstacles are a ramp, a tunnel, walls, seesaw, and a couple of cones

How it interacts with each obstacle:
With our ramp, it's a 4 way, so first the robot will go at one side, and go over it. Then it will pass through some cones. After the cones there are the wall where the bot has to try not to hit. 
Then we have our tunnel where the robot has to go through. And after that it will have to go on the seesaw. Once it gets off the seesaw. It has to go on the ramp again, but on another side. Then going over it which is when the obstacke course stops

How to run our Python Script:


What worked well, and what didn't:
Our design process was quite easy, as our group was quick and efficient in our work. Finishing our plan in a day. And using the rest of the time to make our obstacles. Which we completed early.
We evely distrubuted our work which made things a lot easier, sticking to our strengths. Though we did face a couple of challenges, such as some of the measurements with our obstacles. SOme of our 
obstacles being to big so we had to size some things down. But overall it went well.
